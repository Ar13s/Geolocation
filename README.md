# Geolocation
Geolocation is the start to try and build a Geolocation function that will give the MGRS Grid instead of the Latitude and Longtitude.
This is more geared toward the Military and Police as they are more apt to understand the 10 to 12 Digid Grid Reference, whereas Pilots 
  are more intune with the Lat and Long location. 

Another intent is to evaluate the ability to create a tracking ability indoors in austere environments and the ability to embed the code 
  into existing technology to assist in this effort.
